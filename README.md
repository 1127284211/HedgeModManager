# Sonic Lost World Mod Loader
A Mod Loader for Sonic Lost World on the PC! :D Currently a WIP.

##How do I use this?
Simply make a "mods" folder within your Sonic Lost World installation directory, then place a bunch of folders inside said mods directory (one for each mod) each containing all the modified files you'd like the game to load. Then, just fire up the mod loader (SLWModLoader.exe), check the checkbox(es) next to the mods you'd like to use in-game, and click "Play!"

Example mod file/folder structure:
